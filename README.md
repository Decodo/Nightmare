### Disclaimer

The following example is a simple script showing how to utilize Smartproxy with Nightmare.js.
We suggest to reseach [Nightmare.js](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare#api) documentation in order to continue development with this tool.

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with Nigtmare.js, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilising `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Smartproxy/master/nightmarejs/nightmare.js > nightmare.js`

3. You should see a new file named nightmare.js in your project folder. Edit it using an editor of your choice.

4. To setup your username and password change the according fields in within punctuation marks (''). You can also choose an endpoint which you would like to use by editing `proxy-server:` parameter.
