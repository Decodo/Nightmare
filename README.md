### Disclaimer

The following example is a simple script showing how to utilize Smartproxy with Nightmare.js.
We suggest to research [Nightmare.js](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare#api) documentation in order to continue development with this tool.

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with Nigtmare.js, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilizing `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smartproxy/Nightmare/master/nightmare.js > nightmare.js`

3. You should see a new file named nightmare.js in your project folder. Edit it using an editor of your choice.

4. To setup your username and password change the according fields within punctuation marks (''). You can also choose an endpoint that you would like to use by editing the `proxy-server:` parameter.

### Usage

To run this example script, while in your project folder, run the following command:

`node nightmare.js`

If you did everything correctly, you should see an IP appearing from our proxy server once the script finishes running.
